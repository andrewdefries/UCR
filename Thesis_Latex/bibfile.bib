\begin{abstract}
Chemical genetic exploration of the clickable library of 4,000 terminal acetylenes revealed an iodo-acetylene containing verbanone, CLK026D11. The synthetic volatile compound, CLK026D11, strongly inhibited growth of {\it Arabidopsis thaliana} in growth media and was potent also as a volatile exchanged from impregnated media. A developmental analysis was performed with {\it Arabidopsis} as well as other angiosperms to elaborate the spectrum of defects caused by administration of CLK026D11. Morphological defects involving swollen and twisted hypocotyl cell files. Through collaborative efforts the bioactive spectrum of CLK026D11 was determined for the model plant {\it Arabidopsis thaliana}, the model yeast {\it Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, model bread mold {\it Neurospora crassa}. The molecular target of CLK026D11 is not known, and evidence is presented hereforth to accelerate future advances.

\section{Introduction}

\dropcap{N}he growth of the dicotyledonous plant {\it Arabidopsis} follows a simple and distinct set of developmental milestones (Figure ~\ref{fig:GrowthandDevelopment}). When the seed absorbs water and is properly chilled at 4${}^\circ$ C for four days the seed will germinate (Figure ~\ref{fig:GrowthandDevelopment} stage 01). Hydrostatic pressure causes the radicle, or primordial root, to emerge from the seed coat (Figure ~\ref{fig:GrowthandDevelopment} stage 3-5). Hypocotyl elongation is exaggerated in the dark and will continue until exposed to light (Figure ~\ref{fig:GrowthandDevelopment} stage 6-9)\cite{lehman1996hookless1}. The hypocotyl elongation aids the escape from the seed husk while the cotyledon and apical hook retain a protective angle until permissive conditions arise, as will be detailed.

The apical meristem, the future above ground body of the plant is a subpopulation of totipotential cells \cite{westhoff1998molecular}. This important population of cell is physically protected from damage during seedling emergence by a coordinated process between the cell adjacent to the cotyledon on the stem (Figure ~\ref{fig:CotyledonandAngleDemo}A-E). These cells grow at an uneven rate on the apical and basal side of the stem to preserve the apical hook. Exposure to light accompanied with soil emergence causes a loss of skotomorphogenesis or differential cellular growth and the apical hook \cite{guzman1990exploiting}. During this process the cotyledon is changing internal metabolism, enlarges, and emerges from the soil gravitropically and then peels back (Figure ~\ref{fig:CotyledonandAngleDemo}B-C) to begin the first true leaf development from stem cells in the apical meristem (Figure ~\ref{fig:CotyledonandAngleDemo}C) \cite{westhoff1998molecular}.

Growth of dicots in the dark is characterized by cell elongation in the direction opposite to gravity, and this response terminates in response to light. Etiolated anisotropic hypocotyl expansion is a phenotypic process limited by hydrostatic processes in elongation and expansion regulated by cell wall synthesis and developmental programs \cite{ishida2007twisted,lehman1996hookless1}. Etiolated growth facilitates emergence from the ground, and leads to an ideal spatial separation of the root and shoot with air, water and light gradients that dictate future organ differentiation in response to photosynthesis. It is our goal to discover compounds that perturb any or all of the processes of etiolated growth and intend to study these bioactives to determine the overall mechanism of action.

%------------------------------------------------

\section{Results}

We have identified several bioactives from a novel small molecule library of terminal acetylenes that are promising probes for plant chemical genetics. Final lead probes were discovered by first chemical genetic screening of the model plant {\it Arabidopsis thaliana} and model yeast {it Saccharomyces cerevisiae} on the terminal acetylene four thousand compound building block library. m {\%} were bioactive in plant Figure \ref{ScreenTreeFlowChartWPercent} , and z {\%} were bioactive in yeast Figure \ref{ScreenTreeFlowChartWPercent}. Compounds that caused a change in the typical growth and development were considered bioactive. Bioactive terminal acetylenes were found to span several domains of chemical space Figure \ref{Clickable_rgl_color}. We navigated this chemical space using a high throughput combinatorial approach and found three probes amenable to functionalization into photoaffinity ligand without a loss in bioactivity.

\label{fig:CamphorLikeClade}
\end{figure}

Clade N, with the core iodoacetylene member CLK026D11 was compared to compounds with similar pinane-like and adamantane carbon skeletons in the clickable library (Figure ~\ref{fig:CamphorLikeClade}A, inset blue circle, see supplementary table). Despite possessing similar carbon skeletons or iodoacetylenes the compounds CLK026D11 and CLK026H11 distinctly caused the same phenotype (Figure ~\ref{fig:PTFP2}). CLK026D11 is similar to compounds in natural product datasets, and this may be a consequence of the synthesis of CLK026D11 and CLK026H11 from verbenone and verbanone respectively (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11Retrosynthesis}A-D)\cite{dikusar2001synthesis}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CLK026D11 is a potent volatile inhibitor of anisotropic growth}

Volatiles, such as ethylene, can function as growth regulators in plants \cite{lehman1996hookless1}. Preparation of the iodoacetylenes CLK026D11 and CLK026H11 describes the compounds as unstable, although 1HNMR analysis confirmed the structure as reported \cite{dikusar2001synthesis}. Volatility of CLK026D11 was suspected due to a low molecular weight and the reason for observed variation on the edges of treatment and control plates. An experiment was conducted to demonstrate CLK026D11 was potent at a distance. {\it Arabidopsis} was grown in media vertically and another plate containing compound was placed on top to exchange head space.

\begin{figure}

Growth of plates containing DMSO alone showed typical bagplot variance whereas CLK026D11 was potent to inhibit hypocotyl and root growth down to 1 $\mu$M (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11ComesThroughTheAir}A and B). Iodine was used as a control as it was suspected that the iodoacetylene CLK026D11 may degrade to release iodine. Nonetheless, iodine at all concentrations was inactive, and did not cause a phenotype by exchanging head space with the control plate (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11ComesThroughTheAir}C).  CLK026D11 was potent to produce identical phenotypes in seedlings on the control plate when place a few centimeters away at 25 $\mu$M doses (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11ComesThroughTheAir}D).

\subsubsection{Cellular features of the perturbation caused by CLK026D11}

\begin{figure}

\caption{CLK026D11 causes anisotropic hypocotyl growth phenotypes with a handedness similar to chuboxypyr. A. Columbia-0 seedling control treatment (1{\%} DMSO).

\label{fig:CLK026D11SEM}
\end{figure}

Low doses of CLK026D11 and structurally dissimilar chuboxypyr \cite{Zhao_Hyr1} induced right handed helical hypocotyl twisting as visualized by scanning electrom microscopy (SEM) (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11SEM}B and C), whereas higher doses disrupted etiolated ansiotropoic hypocotyl expansion to result in radially expanding cells rather than typical expansion lengthwise against gravity (Figure ~\ref{fig:CLK026D11SEM}D). These growth features were known to be caused by a number of structurally dissimilar compounds such as oryzalin \cite{bannigan2006cortical,bartels1973comparison}, taxol \cite{baskin1994morphology,morejohn1987oryzalin}, and morlin \cite{debolt2007morlin} with modes of action related to microtubule homeostasis [185] and cellulose synthase function (CeSA) \cite{debolt2007morlin}.

\section{Discussion}

\subsubsection{CLK026D11 is unique and potent bioactive but could not be used to reveal mechanism of action (MOA)}

Exploration of the swollen cell phenotype caused by CLK026D11 and CLK026H11 (Clade O) is of significance to elucidate molecular and cellular events that lead to the adaptive evolution of skotomorphogenesis and etiolated growth in a number of angiosperms \cite{gendreau1997cellular, gendreau1998phytochrome}. The clade N compounds phenocopy mutants characterized as microtubule proteins \cite{nakamura2004low} and can be examined further with mutant analysis. 

%explain this assay in methods as well as iodine dissolution


%Bioactivity of CLK026D11 across Eukaryotic taxa (data not shown) was interesting but did not provide complementary evidence to determine the MOA in {\it Arabidopsis}. 

Clade M is has probes that come with a literature history, thus when evidence is discovered there is already information available for comparison. We will see how one of two clade M probes can be used to find the responsible allele in Chapter 5. Target identification efforts with EMS. 

The bioactivity of the CLK026D11 was interesting but was difficult to determine MOA in {\it Arabidopsis} since the compound was volatile in the growth media and caused a significant amount of phenotype variation in large plates. CLK026D11 did participate in the click reaction to give the expected product, but was not bioactive when reacted with the fluorophore azide building blocks tested. Therefore, CLK026D11 was not useful, in our scheme, as a tagged compound and was discarded.

\subsection{Preparation of assay plates for the testing of the bioactive volatile CLK026D11}

Single well assay plates (NUNC) were grown vertically and taped together with different doses of 1, 5, 10, 15, 25 $\mu$M CLK026D11 and (1{\%}) DMSO was used as control. Growth media and seed preparation was indicated previously (Materials and Methods: Chapter 3), except seedlings were placed onto the media on the fourth day or the first day of growth in dark. Plates were photographed on the seventh day using a digital camera and LED transillumination.

\end{figure}

Images for quantitative bagplots were acquired using a hand held 2.0 Mega Pixel digital camera. Assay plates were photographed using standard position and distances for consistancy (Figure~\ref{fig:2D_Capture}). Illumination was provided by an LED transilluminator placed directly underneath the assay plates. Photographs were measured by hand using the ImageJ polyline tool. Hypocotyl and root variables were exported from ImageJ and processed in R using the bivariate bagplot() call in the package aplapack.

\subsection{Preparation of {\it Arabidopsis} for scanning electron microscopy}

Arabidopsis seedlings prepared identically to the chemical genetic screen are imbibed for 4 days at 4${}^\circ$ C and grown for 3 days in the dark. On the final day seedlings were transferred directly onto a Hitachi scanning electron microscope (SEM) specimen stage with adhesive and flash frozen immediately using isopentane chilled via liquid nitrogen. The sample was placed into the vacuum chamber of the SEM for electron scan and imaging.
